Hamiltonian and iQCC simulation results for Ammonia (NH3) using geometry from the NIST website: https://cccbdb.nist.gov/energy2x.asp
and using the basis set and CAS reported in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05726.pdf
There could be some differences in the exact MO selection since the above publication does not report in detail the exact method for orbital selection.
The GAMESS input files are included (SCF and CI) for others to reproduce the Hamiltonian.
